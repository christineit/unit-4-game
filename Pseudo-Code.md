1. Define: global variables
   var targetNum;
   var lost;
   var win;

for (i=0 ; i,4 ; i++) {
console
}

Pseudo Code:

1. A game with 4 crystals and random result
2. Every crystal needs to have a random number b/t 1-12
3. A new random number should be generated every single time we win or lose game
4. When clicking crystal, it should add the previous numbers clicked until it equals the target number
5. If it is greater than the target number then we increment a loss and game resets
6. If it is equal then we increment a win counter
